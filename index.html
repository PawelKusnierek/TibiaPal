    <span class="title">Exercise Weapons & Training Calculators Updated</span>
</div>
<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hi guys! <br><br>
        Today I've enhanced both the <b>'Exercise Weapons Calculator'</b> and <b>'Training Calculator'</b> with brand new modes! <br><br>
        
        <b>ðŸŽ¯ Exercise Weapons Calculator</b><br>
        The calculator now supports two modes:<br><br>
        
        <b>Target Skill</b> (original functionality):<br>
        Calculate how many exercise weapons you need to use to get from skill X to skill Y.<br><br>
        
        <b>Target Weapons Used</b> (new functionality):<br>
        Calculate how much skill you will gain when using a specified number of exercise weapons.<br><br>
        
        <b>Key Features of the New Mode:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Choose between Regular, Durable, or Lasting exercise weapons</li>
        <li>Enter the exact number of weapons you plan to use</li>
        <li>Get precise skill gain calculations with decimal precision (e.g., skill 100.70)</li>
        </ul><br>
        
        <b>ðŸŽ¯ Training Calculator</b><br>
        The Training Calculator has also been enhanced with a dual-mode:<br><br>
        
        <b>Target Skill Mode</b> (original functionality):<br>
        Calculate how long it will take to reach your target skill while offline or online training.<br><br>
        
        <b>Target Time Mode</b> (new functionality):<br>
        Calculate what skill level you will achieve after training for a specified amount of time.<br><br>
        
        <b>Key Features of the New Mode:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Enter your training time in hours</li>
        <li>Get precise skill gain calculations with decimal precision</li>
        <li>See time display in human-readable format (years, months, days, hours)</li>
        <li>Supports both offline and online training calculations</li>
        </ul><br>
                
        You can find the enhanced calculators at:<br>
        <a href="https://tibiapal.com/exercise" target="_blank">https://tibiapal.com/exercise</a><br>
        <a href="https://tibiapal.com/offlinetraining" target="_blank">https://tibiapal.com/offlinetraining</a><br><br>
        
        Hope you find the new functionality useful for your skill training planning!<br><br>

    <span class="title">Updates to 'Hunting Places' and 'Vocation Equipment Reference'</span>
</div>
<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hi guys! <br><br>
        Today I made a few changes to <b>'Hunting Places'</b> and <b>'Vocation Equipment Reference'</b>. <br>
        <ul>
        <li>All 'Hunting Places' (Solo Knight, Duo, THs etc.) have been merged into a single page (/hunting/) instead of many sub-pages (/hunting/soloknight/ etc.) for easier navigation
        <li>Equipment Reference has been updated with a new filter, 'Protection', that allows you to filter gear for your vocation based on the elemental protection it provides
        <li>Equipment Reference Knight weapons have been updated to include their respective elemental damage type and a corresponding filter has also been added 
        </ul>

    <span class="title">Vocation Equipment Reference now available</span>
</div>
<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hi guys! <br><br>
        Today I published a new tool called <b>'Vocation Equipment Reference'</b> - <a href="https://tibiapal.com/equipment" target="_blank">link.</a><br><br>
        It's purpose is to provide a single page interface to browse all items per vocation/item type.<br><br>
        I always found it a bit cumbersome to find all the relevant gear for a particular vocation so I made this mostly for myself - but I hope it also helps some of you! <br>

    <span class="title">Celebration Time - 2k TC Giveaway & TWO Contests</span>
</div>
<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hello! <br><br>
        We have a lot to celebrate! Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kusnierr" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> has almost reached 10k subscribers, our <a href="https://discord.gg/kbjqY2VRa9" target="_blank">Discord</a> server has recently crossed the 1000 users mark & TibiaPal will be live for 4 years this month! <br><br>
        To mark these occasions we are running a major giveaway & TWO separate contests! Details below!<br><br>

    <b><span id="new-homepage">Giveaway</span></b><br><br>
    <b>Prizes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>8x 250 Tibia Coins (2000 Tibia Coins total)</li>
        <li>1x Beaver of Wisdom</li>
    </ul><br>
    <b>Eligibility:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy! You simply need to be a member of the TibiaPal <a href="https://discord.gg/kbjqY2VRa9" target="_blank">Discord</a> server on the day we hit 10k <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kusnierr" target="_blank">YouTube</a> subscribers (estimated late April/early May). That's when a random draw from all TibiaPal <a href="https://discord.gg/kbjqY2VRa9" target="_blank">Discord</a> users will take place and the nine lucky winners will be selected.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <b><span id="new-homepage">CONTEST 1: Tibia AI Image Generation</span></b><br><br>
    <b>Prizes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: golden warrior trophy and Beaver of Wisdom</li>
        <li>2nd place: silver warrior trophy and Music Box</li>
        <li>3rd place: bronze warrior trophy and choose one taming item out of these: Tin Key, Reins, Giant Shrimp, Foxtail, Golden Can of Oil, Decorative Ribbon, Maxilla Maximus</li>    
    </ul><br>
    <b>Contest Details:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Use any AI Image Generation Tool (e.g. <a href="https://www.bing.com/images/create" target="_blank">Bing Image Creator</a>) to create the most interesting/funny/cool Tibia/TibiaPal AI based image</li>
        <li>Have fun. There are no strict guidelines, we want to see what crazy interesting stuff AI can come up with!</li>
        <li>Obviously no NSFW/inappropriate/illegal/copyrighted etc. content</li>
    </ul><br>

    <b><span id="new-homepage">CONTEST 2: Design the next Tibia item</span></b><br><br>
    <b>Prizes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: golden trophy of excellence and choice between Beaver of Wisdom, Grey Tome, Yellow Rose</li>
        <li>2nd place: silver trophy of excellence and choice between the remaining two items</li>
        <li>3rd place: bronze trophy of excellence and remaining item</li>    
    </ul><br>

    <b>Contest Details:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Design the next Tibia item! Submit a written description of the item (name, weight, stats, slot, special abilities etc., anything relevant), no sprite or art of any kind required</li>
        <li>The item should be an equipment piece (weapon, armor, legs etc.)</li>
        <li>The item should more or less fit within the current Tibian power-level (e.g. no 5 imbue slot weapons, 200 attack weapons etc.)</li>
        <li>The power level is up to you, it can be a level 100 item, or a level 2000 item, as long as its stats feasibly reflect its target level range</li>
        <li>Other than that - go wild! We want to see some interesting ideas and designs, add existing abilities/buffs to items or feel free to come up with entirely new abilities/buffs - but remember to not make them too overpowered!</li>
        <li>The item will be judged based on appropriate power level, design, Tibian lore/setting fit, uniqueness etc.</li>
        <li>There is no strict character/word limit, but if you need to submit an A4 page of text for your item it probably won't win. Treat existing items as an estimate for how long an item description should be</li>
        <li>Obviously this is for fun only and none of the items will be implemented into the game</li>
    </ul><br>

    <b><span id="new-homepage">HOW TO ENTER/SUBMISSION DETAILS</span></b>
    <ul>
        <li>Post your submissions in the TibiaPal <a href="https://discord.gg/kbjqY2VRa9" target="_blank">Discord</a> Server, in channels: #ai-contest-submissions or #item-contest-submissions</li>
        <li>Submissions are open until the day we hit 10k <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kusnierr" target="_blank">YouTube</a> subscribers (estimated late April/early May), best to submit early to not accidentally miss this milestone</li>
        <li>In the unlikely event of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kusnierr" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel suddenly gaining subscribers very quickly and the contests ending too abruptly, we reserve the right to extend the submission period by a few days</li>
        <li>Only one submission (one AI image, one item) per user per contest (you can submit to both contests)</li>
    </ul>

    <br>Happy celebrations! It's thanks to all of you that TibiaPal & our <a href="https://discord.gg/kbjqY2VRa9" target="_blank">Discord</a> Server & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kusnierr" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel continue growing, thank you!<br>

    <span class="title">Sunsetting 'Boss Timers'</span>
</div>
<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hello! <br><br>
        Today we have taken the decision to remove the 'Boss Timers' functionality. <br><br>

        Since CipSoft implemented Bosstiary some updates ago, TibiaPals 'Boss Timers' usage has basically dropped by over 99%. <br><br>
        The feature was polluting the codebase with no longer used code/assets so we have taken the decision to remove it all in order to improve the loading times etc. of TibiaPal.
        <br><br>
        Apologies to any of you who may have still been using it. We hope you enjoyed the feature when it was more useful! <3

</div>
<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hello! <br><br>
    Today we went live with a fully re-worked back-end infrastructure for TibiaPal. The site has been re-written in Python/Django and is now being hosted on a different server. <br><br>
    This means that going forward we will be able to work on much interesting tools as we now have access to web scraping and a database. Stay tuned for more information on new features! <br><br>
    For now there should be no impact to users, the only thing you will notice is the re-worked navigation bar on the left, which now has more free space to add new features in the future.<br><br>
    Also, if you would like to inspect the new code, or contribute to the project, TibiaPal.com will always be publicly hosted on <a href="https://github.com/PawelKusnierek/TibiaPal">GitHub</a>. We welcome your contributions!

        The time for TibiaPal to have its own fansite item has come and we need your help, please help us to

        <b>TIMELINE:</b><br><br>

        The submissions will be initially judged by the fansite admin team and top 3 choices will

        <b>WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:</b><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We would like the fansite item to be an animal doll (hint: we really like the look of demon baby
            dolls from Demon's Lullaby event!)
        </li>
        <li>It can be any animal but extra points for either a beaver (like the TibiaPal logo!) or any
            animal generally associated with intelligence/learning
        </li>
        <li>More extra points if the animal will be wearing glasses and/or using a calculator or any other
            tools/items that are associated with intelligence/learning
        </li>
        <li>As a decoration, we expect it to be eye-catching and look great when on a table, a pedestal or
            on the floor!
        </li>
    </ul>


    <p><b>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:</b><br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>size: 32 x 32 pixel</li>
        <li>it can be animated, but may contain 128 frames at most</li>
        <li>each frame can have a different exposure time (which is usually at around 100 to 200 ms per
            frame)
        </li>
        <li>if you want pauses within the animation, do not include the same frame multiple times in a row,
            but instead increase the exposure time for this specific frame
        </li>
        <li>it needs to be on a transparent background (1-bit transparency only)</li>
        <li>if it is animated, you only need to supply an animated GIF of the item</li>
        <li>otherwise it needs to be saved as a 24bit PNG file</li>
    </ul>

    <br><b>CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>it needs to fit into Tibia's setting</li>
        <li>it should not contain any direct references to a country, e.g. a Brazilian flag</li>
        <li>it's a deco or fun item only, it will not change any character skills or stats</li>
        <li>it needs to be a takable item, for example it cannot be solid furniture, but a bedside lamp
            would be alright
        </li>
    </ul>

    <br><b>GRAPHICAL STYLE</b>
    <ul>
        <li>The outermost outline (in all places, where the item borders the transparent background) needs
            to be black. The only exception is when the object has parts that are self-illuminating - like
            the flames of a torch. In this example, the outline around the flames needs to be a darker shade
            of the outermost color of the flames, while the rest of the torch has a black outline.
        </li>
        <li>The primary light source should generally come from the top left corner.</li>
        <li>it shouldn't be too different from other Tibia items</li>
        <li>CipSoft's content team reserves the right to revise the item</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>GOOD LUCK!<br>--Kusnier

    <p>Hello everyone, <br><br> Today I added an automatically pre-selected checkbox 'TC over 10500gp' to

        Having this selected will result in output only mentioning the price in gp/kk, while having it

        official Tibia fansite! Plus some other changes...</span></div>
<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hello everyone, <br><br> Last week TibiaPal.com became an official Tibia fansite, endorsed by
        CipSoft! Thank you all for using the site and coming back every day, I couldn't be more happy!<br>
        In a few months we will have a contest for a fansite item so stay tuned! :) <br><br>

        In addition, I made some navigational changes to the site.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>In order to clean up the navigation bar, some less used tools have been moved into 'Other
            Tools' section, you can still use them of course under this link <a
                href="https://tibiapal.com/othertools">Other Tools</a>.
        </li>
        <li>I combined the 'organisational' sorts of pages into one. Previously we had separate pages for
            About/Contact/Privacy Policy/Archive. They are now all under the 'About' subsite, which can be
            found here <a href="https://tibiapal.com/about">About & Contact</a>.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br> <br>

    I hope the changes will make it easier to browse the site! And thanks again everyone for your support,
    we made it as a fansite!!!!<br><br>

<article class="main-article">
    <p>Hello everyone, <br><br> Today I added the much requested 'History' feature to

        Of course this will only work on new results you enter from today on, unfortunately not any of your
        older results. <br><br>

    <p>Hello and welcome to TibiaPal.com! You are most likely coming here from tibialootsplit.com, in which

    <p>I decided to re-brand TibiaLootSplit as 'TibiaPal' because I have plenty of exciting ideas for
        content and tools that I would like to create on top of 'TibiaLootSplit'. The name 'TibiaPal'
        conveys a lot better what I intend to do with the site :)</p>
    <p>I am planning to update some already existing tools on other Tibia fansites, such as the imbue
        calculator. For now, I created an active house auctions tool, which you can find by clicking
        <b>'House
            Auctions'</b> on the left - this is more useful for worlds with fewer houses, such as Secura or
        Antica
        where using the built-in game house search takes a lot of time.
    </p>
    <p>Anyway, I have plenty more ideas so stay tuned!</p><br>
