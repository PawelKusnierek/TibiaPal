The .html code for this website is generated using Jekyll and saved in the '_site' directory.

If you are not comfortable with using Jekyll, but you would still like to contribute, you can simply create a pull request adding plain html/css/javascript in the '_site' directory. 
However, it will not be merged as is. I will review it and add it properly as part of the Jekyll build process.

Thanks to everyone who wishes to contribute.
