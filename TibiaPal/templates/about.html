<button type="button" class="expandable-div">About TibiaPal.com</button>
<div class="expandable-div-content">
    <p class="about_p">Welcome to TibiaPal.com everyone! :)<br></p>
    <p class="about_p">TibiaPal was originally started as 'TibiaLootSplit.com', which most of you know and
        love.
        <br><br>
        I created TibiaLootSplit because I was tired of always manually splitting the teamhunt loot - and so
        TibiaLootSplit.com was born.
    </p>
    <p class="about_p">TibiaLootSplit's popularity spread like wildfire through the community thanks to word
        of
        mouth and quickly had tens of thousands of uses a month (thank you!). </p>
    <p class="about_p">After a few months of working on TibiaLootSplit.com, I decided that the tool was
        mature
        enough and most features I could think of I already implemented. That's when I decided to branch out
        and
        built TibiaPal.com!</p>
    <p class="about_p">TibiaPal.com is an extension of TibiaLootSplit and has many more tools for the
        community
        to use to enhance their Tibia experience!</p>
    <p class="about_p">I continue working on a number of tools and requests (keep them coming!), so please
        stay
        tuned for future Tibia tool updates :)</p>
    <br>Much love and see you in Tibia! <br><br>
    <div>Yours, <br>
