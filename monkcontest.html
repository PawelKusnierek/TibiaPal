<div id="Funding" class="tabcontent">
<p>I will be paying for the bounties myself, but if you would like to contribute to the event, any TC donations sent to my character '<b>Kusnier</b>' between now and the Monks' release will be fully added to the bounty prize pool. <br><br><span style="color:gold">THANK YOU!</span><br><br>
In addition, if you donate over a certain threshold, you will be able to design* a bounty yourself. If you donate:
    <ul id="monklist">
            <li>Over 100 TC, you can design an Easy bounty
            <li>Over 250 TC, you can design a Medium bounty
            <li>Over 1000 TC, you can design a Hard bounty
    </ul>
<br>*obviously the bounties need to make thematic sense so I reserve the right to reject them/discuss with you how to change them <br>
</p>

<div id="Rules" class="tabcontent">
    <p>
        <ul id="monklist">
            <li>There is no need to register for the event in any way, it's free and open to everyone
            <li>Bounties can only be completed by Monk characters (obviously)
            <li>Once a bounty has been claimed, it cannot be claimed again
            <li>To claim a bounty, include a full in-game screenshot completing the bounty in our <a href="https://discord.gg/kbjqY2VRa9" target="_blank">Discord</a>, in channel #bounty-claim. Any other special conditions and/or restrictions (e.g. no rooking, requires video) are explained directly on each bounty. Once verified, I will contact you for character name to deliver the reward to
            <li>Reward is paid out to the first person to successfully claim it on the Discord server, NOT necessarily the first person who completes it in game - we do not want to police timezones etc., so simply claim in Discord as soon as you can to ensure you win. Time of claim in the Discord server will be the only deciding factor.
        </ul>
